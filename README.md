# SSW-345-Assignments

This repository will be a hub for all SSW 345 assignments. Creating this GitHub repository along with an issue to track homework tasks was a part of the first Homework assignment for this course. Additionally, I created a Homework manual, learned to use Git proficiently by completing a series of challenging levels, and documented progress with screenshots and detailed explanations utilizing Overleaf. More assignments will continue to be added as this class progresses and more assignments are completed.
