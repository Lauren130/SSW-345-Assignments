# SSW-345-Assignments

In this assignment, I created a Homework manual, learned to use Git proficiently by completing a series of challenging levels, and documented progress with screenshots and detailed explanations utilizing Overleaf. Then, I created this GitHub repository along with an issue to track homework tasks. Through this assignment, I have gained practical Git skills to add to my knowledge of Software Engineering.
